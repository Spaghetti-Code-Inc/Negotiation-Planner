Random quality of life changes:
6. Add info buttons to more places on app
20. Some text fields do not let you type until you press into them twice
22. Make BATNA Dropdown always open
23. Exit negotiation on negotiation rubric should be locked to bottom of the screen
24. Work on focussing the user input when enter is pressed
25. If there is no summary the space shouldn't be there on "MyNegotiations"

Lucas:
TODO Make negotiation parse real values

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it hast lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6..

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8..

Backlog:
1. Sliders should not pass over each other in edit negotiation page.

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?

Notes:
1. 3 Describers on the first page shouldn't be buttons
3. Resizing the screen when something is being typed and it can not be seen
10. Change what is shown up on the sliders and what values are shown

1. Pick a datatype on determine the issues page
2. Labels should be datatype
3 Regular text on BATNA screen
