Random quality of life changes:
1. Add counter of how many points are used on CP Rubric
1.1 Make counter = 100 if theres only on issue on CP Rubric
2. Make sure all the inputs can not go over 100 points or a max value
6. Add info buttons to more places on app
7. Save the negotiation whenever the user wants to exit a negotiation in the middle of creating one
8. Error on determine the issues page
9. Make the 100 on the multithumbsliders all the way to the right
10. Evaluate Agreement page the issue sliders have there own scrollview
11. Negotiation Rubric Page, Divider has padding or width that is not black which cuts off text before it should

Lucas:
TODO - Evaluate Agreement points at rubric page


Edit Negotiation:
1. Make it actually looks decent

Evaluate Negotiation Page:
3. Show letter evaluation on view negotiation screen
4. Show the current value of the negotiation on the sliders as well
5. Change Tradeoff button to send to tradeoffs, not just pop

Cleaning Code:
1. Combine the ViewCurrentIssues and ViewNegotiationCurrent classes
2. Organizing lib folder better
3. Make all of values in Firebase the right type of data (remove parse(type.toString())
4. Create an issue class
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes

Backlog:
1. Sliders should not pass over each other in edit negotiation page.
