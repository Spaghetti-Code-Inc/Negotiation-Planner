Random quality of life changes:
33. Info Buttons for all <MultiThumbSliders>
36. Tradeoffs saved to negotiation [Plan Summary] - entered in by a list of bullets
39. Allow commas when entering real values in [Issue Values]
40. Going back from [Plan Summary] sends you back 2 pages
41. Save total value of negotiation to firestore
42. If only one issue, do not have an "Overall Negotiation Rating" on [Track Progress]

Lucas:
TODO Change from Android App to Flutter App on Firebase
TODO Apply [Track Progress] Save/Discard to [View Rubric]

Track Progress Page Updates:
1. Sliders on Track Progress should be <MultiThumbSliders>
        - Each slider should have Real Value on top and Points on Bottom without weird edge cases
        - The real values are linearly based between the two settlement values closest to it
2. <Calculate> Shows current total points of negotiation
        - This is where trade offs should be shown

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6. Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?
7..

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8. Do an overall code coverage test
9. How to refresh super class from lower class
10..

Backlog:
1. Work on focussing the user input when enter is pressed

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?

Notes:
1. 3 Describers on the first page shouldn't be buttons
