Random quality of life changes:
22. Make BATNA Dropdown always open
33. Info Buttons for Sliders needs worked on
34..

Lucas:
TODO Make negotiation parse real values
TODO Add type checking for real world value on step 3/3
TODO Have choice to apply data type to rest of the issue, make user only have to enter number for the rest

What I want:
1. User Has to press A's <Real Value> - Light up a different color - If pressed another one is pressed pop up that A needs to be done first

OR

1. Let every <Real Value> button have its own popup, advise user that changing one datatype changes them all
2. <Real Value> Buttons that do not have a value should show the datatype as the Button text

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6. Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?
7..

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8..

Backlog:
1. Work on focussing the user input when enter is pressed

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?

Notes:
1. 3 Describers on the first page shouldn't be buttons

1. Pick a datatype on determine the issues page
3. Regular text on BATNA screen
