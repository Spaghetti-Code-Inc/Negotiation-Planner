Random quality of life changes:
33. Info Buttons for all <MultiThumbSliders>
36. Tradeoffs saved to negotiation [Plan Summary] - entered in by a list of bullets
39. Allow commas when entering real values in [Issue Values]
45. Show which letter is currently active on [Issue Values]

Lucas:

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6. Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?
7..

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8. Do an overall code coverage test
9. How to refresh super class from lower class without passing a refresh function
10..

Backlog:
1 + 4. Work on focussing the user input when enter is pressed + Make it possible to click out of keyboard screens
2. <View Total Negotiation> Shows current total points of negotiation
        - This is where trade offs should be shown
        - Give summary of each issue and what the value is
3. If only one issue, do not have an "Overall Negotiation Rating" on [Track Progress]

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?

Notes:
1. 3 Describers on the first page shouldn't be buttons
2. Right now [Track Progress] Only shows real values for up to two decimals
