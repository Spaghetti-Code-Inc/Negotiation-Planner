Random quality of life changes:
6. Add info buttons to more places on app
7. Save the negotiation whenever the user wants to exit a negotiation in the middle of creating one
10. Evaluate Agreement page the issue sliders have there own scrollview, they should not
11. Negotiation Rubric Page, Divider has padding or width that is not black which cuts off text before it should
12. Issue Names overflow, create upperbound or way to accept longer issue names
13. Make the values save after you pop backwards and go forwards when you expect values to still be there
15. Make the IssueValues Page have drop downs for the letter grades
16?. Show the current rubric when asking for users current offer


Lucas:
TODO CP Issues do not pop created then deleted issues


Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it hast lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Make a calculate button on track progress to return the best possible negotiation
    (Might not be possible because functions are linear and are best either all the way to left or right)

Cleaning Code:
3. Make all of values in Firebase the right type of data (remove parse(type.toString())
4. Create an issue class
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes

Backlog:
1. Sliders should not pass over each other in edit negotiation page.

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?
2. CP Issues does not remove the deleted issues
