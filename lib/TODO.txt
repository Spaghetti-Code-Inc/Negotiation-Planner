Random quality of life changes:
1. Add counter of how many points are used on CP Rubric
1.1 Make counter = 100 if theres only on issue on CP Rubric
2. Make sure all the inputs can not go over 100 points or a max value
6. Add info buttons to more places on app
7. Save the negotiation whenever the user wants to exit a negotiation in the middle of creating one
10. Evaluate Agreement page the issue sliders have there own scrollview, they should not
11. Negotiation Rubric Page, Divider has padding or width that is not black which cuts off text before it should
12. Issue Names overflow, create upperbound or way to accept longer issue names
13. Make the values save after you pop backwards and go forwards when you expect values to still be there
14. Cap all of the inputs at a certain spot


Lucas:
TODO Have user enter currentAgreement early in the rubric -> when redesigning rubric test page
TODO Make the calculate button on the track progress work

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it hast lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations

Cleaning Code:
3. Make all of values in Firebase the right type of data (remove parse(type.toString())
4. Create an issue class
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes

Backlog:
1. Sliders should not pass over each other in edit negotiation page.
