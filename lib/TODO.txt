Random quality of life changes:
22. Make BATNA Dropdown always open
24. Work on focussing the user input when enter is pressed
27. Overlaps on issue bars: Text should be on white background, should not show text behind it.
        Whatever the most recent bar moved is should have priority over the others.
30. Moving a slider to the edge in Negotiation Rubric results in strange things
33. Instead of 'DistributeEvenly' on Weight Issue throwing all extra on last one, it should even it out

Lucas:
TODO Make negotiation parse real values
TODO Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6.

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8..

Backlog:
1. Sliders should not pass over each other in edit negotiation page.

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?

Notes:
1. 3 Describers on the first page shouldn't be buttons

1. Pick a datatype on determine the issues page
2. Labels should be datatype
3. Regular text on BATNA screen
