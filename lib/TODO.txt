Random quality of life changes:
50. 3 Buttons on first page shouldn't be buttons
51. Center "2. Bargaining Range fo Entire Negotiation" on [Plan Summary]
52. A way to change relative values after the negotiation is already made
53. A way to change real values after the negotiation is already made
54. Flip Overall Negotiation with Individual Issues on [Track Progress]
55. Start a negotiation to keep at the top

What is needed before Launch:
1. First page can not have buttons - TODO 50
2. Focussing on the correct form field when enter is pushed for mobile - TODO Backlog 1
7. Star a negotiation to keep at the top - TODO 55

Lucas:
TODO Wednesday: 2
TODO Thursday: Run code coverage
TODO Friday-Weekend: Launch onto website/upload to app stores

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6. Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?
7..

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8. Do an overall code coverage test
9. How to refresh super class from lower class without passing a refresh function
10..

Backlog:
1 + 4. Work on focussing the user input when enter is pressed + Make it possible to click out of keyboard screens
2. <View Total Negotiation> Shows current total points of negotiation
        - This is where trade offs should be shown
        - Give summary of each issue and what the value is
5. Allow commas when entering real values in [Issue Values]
6. Create suggestions for what tradeoffs to do - Could be apart of <View Total Negotiation>

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?
2. On [Issue Values] entering real values in ascending order than going back and changing relative values
    makes the negotiation show an error - something to do with point system
