Random quality of life changes:
6. Add info buttons to more places on app
7. Save the negotiation whenever the user wants to exit a negotiation in the middle of creating one
10. Evaluate Agreement page the issue sliders have there own scrollview, they should not
11. Negotiation Rubric Page, Divider has padding or width that is not black which cuts off text before it should
16?. Show the current rubric when asking for users current offer
18. Fix the cpRelativeValue inputs


Lucas:
TODO store current user and cp values for the negotiation
TODO 6: Get rid of all the initializing currentNegotiation on StartNewNegotiationPage

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it hast lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes
6. Get rid of all the initializing currentNegotiation on StartNewNegotiationPage

Backlog:
1. Sliders should not pass over each other in edit negotiation page.

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?


Notes:
1. 3 Describers on the first page shouldn't be buttons
2. Added issues should go below the issues that are already named, these should stay in that order the whole time
3. Resizing the screen when something is being type and it can not be seen
4. Change weight issues to be real value points, not percentage of issue relative value
5. Remove A+ deal
6. Have a way to assign a value that corresponds to the letter settlement - Add new column on weight issues page
7. Take out current offer of test drive
8. Show on Rubric Summary how much each issue is weighed
9. Comment out counterpart values - Save for later
10. Correct all of the resizing pages when inputting texts
