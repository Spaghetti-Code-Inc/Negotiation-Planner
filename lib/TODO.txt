Random quality of life changes:
22. Make BATNA Dropdown always open
32. Instead of 'DistributeEvenly' on Weight Issue throwing all extra on last one, it should even it out
33. Info Buttons for Sliders needs worked on
34..

Lucas:
TODO Make negotiation parse real values


Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6. TODO Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?
7..

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8..

Backlog:
1. Work on focussing the user input when enter is pressed

Debugging:
1. Random Null Exception given on "Weight Issues" page but nothing bad happens?

Notes:
1. 3 Describers on the first page shouldn't be buttons

1. Pick a datatype on determine the issues page
2. Labels should be datatype
3. Regular text on BATNA screen
