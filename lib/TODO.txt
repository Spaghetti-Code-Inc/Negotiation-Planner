Random quality of life changes:

56. Make [Determine Issues] reload the issues from negotiation
61. Make Info on [Target & Resistance] not pop every single new screen
66. Pressing Enter on [Determine Issues] creates a new issue popup
68. Add info buttons to SnackBar popups

What is needed before Launch:
TODO FIX ALL BUGS

Lucas:
TODO Friday-Weekend: Launch onto website/upload to app stores

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
2.1 Should they be able to pin a negotiation to top of the screen?
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6. Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?
7..

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8. Do an overall code coverage test
9. How to refresh super class from lower class without passing a refresh function
10..

Backlog:
4. Make it possible to click out of keyboard screens
2. <View Total Negotiation> Shows current total points of negotiation
        - This is where trade offs should be shown
        - Give summary of each issue and what the value is
5. Allow commas when entering real values in [Issue Values]
6. Create suggestions for what tradeoffs to do - Could be apart of <View Total Negotiation>
7. Add Focus Nodes to [Issue Values]
8. A way to change relative values after the negotiation is already made
9. A way to change real values after the negotiation is already made
10. Make the [My Negotiations] list view animated when adding and removing negotiations


Debugging:
2. On [Issue Values] entering real values in ascending order than going back and changing relative values
    makes the negotiation show an error - something to do with point system
5. The app will sometimes duplicate all the values of one negotiation to a different negotiation
    this changes the firestore database, so it is not fixable and needs to be removed.
    This also randomly deleted all of the negotiations somehow - Picture on phone for error message

Notes:
For refreshing on web, the top most class that is showing must be refreshed.
