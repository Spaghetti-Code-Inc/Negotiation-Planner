List of small TODO items

Random quality of life changes:
1. Add counter of how many points are used on CP Rubric
2. Make sure all the inputs can not go over 100 points or a max value
4. Remove async gap between finishing the new negotiation and going to my negotiations
5. Make ViewNegotiation compatible with future - negotiation snap
6. Add info buttons to more places on app
7. Save the negotiation whenever the user wants to exit a negotiation in the middle of creating one

Editing the Values on the viewing screen:
1. Certain values should not be able to pass on top of one another: user Target and User resistance
2. The issues need to be editable as well
3. Show letter evaluation on view negotiation screen
4. Show the current value of the negotiation on the sliders as well
