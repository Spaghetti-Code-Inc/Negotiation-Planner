Random quality of life changes:
56. Make [Determine Issues] reload the issues from negotiation
61. Make Info on [Target & Resistance] not pop every single new screen - Doesn't happen on web
66. Pressing Enter on [Determine Issues] creates a new issue popup
71. Make it so slider do not cover each other between D-B on [Negotiation Rubric]
72. Small ring on login page surrounding loge

What is needed before Launch:
8. DEBUG
10. Make users show up whenever they're created

Lucas:
TODO 8/13 - Remove bugs
TODO Friday-Weekend: Launch onto website/upload to app stores

Ideas:
1. Make the negotiation save the start date to tell how long it has lasted?
2. Have a separate page for completed and non completed negotiations
3. Edit Negotiations After they are made? - Creating/Deleting Issues
4. Save negotiation in the middle of creating one
5. Add compatibility to show counter part values
6. Changing the relative values needs to change the A value for negotiation rubric,
    and change other values if they are greater than the new max value - Should this be allowed?
7. Add info buttons to SnackBar popups
8. If there are no negotiations on [MyNegotiations] display something to the user

Cleaning Code:
5. Make Scaffold's shorter - use more helper classes/listview.builder
7. Convert Rubric Summary, Display Important Issues to a list builder. The index should be the vals[i] shown
8. Do an overall code coverage test
9. How to refresh super class from lower class without passing a refresh function
10. Create 'dispose' for all text editing controllers

Backlog:
2. <View Total Negotiation> Button on [Track Progress] Shows current total points of negotiation
        - This is where trade offs should be shown
        - Give summary of each issue and what the value is
5. Allow commas when entering real values in [Issue Values]
6. Create suggestions for what tradeoffs to do - Could be apart of <View Total Negotiation>
7. Add Focus Nodes to [Issue Values]
8. A way to change relative values after the negotiation is already made
9. A way to change real values after the negotiation is already made
10. Make the [My Negotiations] list view animated when adding and removing negotiations to pinned area
11. Should not have to save email every single time a new negotiation is created - causing waste of money

Debugging:
1. Added two negotiations to pinned, track progress, go to negotiation rubric without saving
    - May happen due to passing the wrong docId
    - happens when two negotiations are both pinned and the latter is picked
    - adding and removing randomly eventually screws it up
